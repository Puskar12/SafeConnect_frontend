    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Fake hiring funnels are one of the most common corporate deception patterns today. They look professional from the outside — polished job listings, fast replies, and enthusiastic HR messages — but behind the scenes, there’s no real intention to hire anyone. The entire process exists to collect data, create noise, or benefit the company without providing any actual opportunity.

    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">How They Work</h1>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      A fake hiring funnel usually follows a predictable sequence:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2">
      <li>Mass job posts across different platforms, often marked as urgent or high-priority.</li>
      <li>Requesting resumes, portfolios, or short assessments to “evaluate fit”.</li>
      <li>Quick screening calls or email responses to appear active and legitimate.</li>
      <li>Delays, generic feedback, or complete silence once the task is submitted.</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
     The pipeline keeps moving, but no one ever reaches the final stage, because the company never intended for the job to be real.
    </p>

  <div>
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Why Companies Do This</h1>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Even without hiring, companies get a lot from these fake funnels:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2">
      <li>A growing database of candidate skills and contact information.</li>
      <li>Free engagement and visibility on job platforms.</li>
      <li>A way to appear busy or expanding to impress clients or investors.</li>
      <li>A pool of people they can contact later for unpaid tasks or promotions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      It’s a recruitment engine designed for everything except actual recruitment.

  <div>
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Red Flags to Watch</h1>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
      Here are the signs most people miss:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2">
      <li>Job posts that stay up for months with no updates.</li>
      <li>No specific job responsibilities, only broad promises.</li>
      <li>Tasks or assessments that feel unrelated or overly detailed.</li>
      <li>No salary range, no office details, and no real interviews.</li>
    </ul>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
      When you see these signs together, the “opportunity” is usually hollow.
    </p>

  <div>
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Why It Matters</h1>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Fake hiring funnels waste time and energy, but the harm goes deeper.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
      They build false hope, keep candidates stuck in long cycles of waiting, and make the job market feel more unstable than it is. Fraud Innovation documents these patterns to help people identify the trap early, move on quickly, and focus on real opportunities.
